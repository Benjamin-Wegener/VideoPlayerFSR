</div>

A high-quality web-based video player that implements AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology in WebGL to upscale and enhance video playback in real-time. This implementation allows you to view local video files with advanced upscaling and sharpening techniques previously only available in desktop applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time FSR Upscaling**: Enhance video quality using AMD's FSR algorithms
- **Local Video Playback**: Play videos directly from your device with no uploading required
- **Playlist Support**: Load multiple videos and navigate between them
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Videos display correctly regardless of dimensions
- **Dynamic Controls**: Intuitive UI that fades when not in use
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Immersive viewing experience
- **CMAA2-inspired Edge Detection**: Improved edge detection for better visual quality
- **Intuitive UI**: Media controls inspired by classic media players

## üíª Browser Support

| Browser | Video Support | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ            | Full support for all features |
| Firefox | ‚úÖ            | Full support for all features |
| Edge    | ‚úÖ            | Includes H.265/HEVC support |
| Safari  | ‚úÖ            | Includes H.265/HEVC support |
| Opera   | ‚úÖ            | Based on Chromium, full support |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Local video files to play

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-Wegener/VideoPlayerFSR
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd VideoPlayerFSR
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser or serve it with a local web server.

### Usage

1. Click the eject (‚èè) button to select video file(s) from your device
2. Use the playback controls to play/pause and navigate between videos
3. Toggle the enhance button (‚ú®) to enable/disable FSR enhancement
4. Use the fullscreen button for a more immersive experience

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology

- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated graphics rendering
- **AMD FSR 1.0.2**: High-quality upscaling algorithm
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic UI and playback control
- **HTML5 Video API**: For video playback capabilities
- **CMAA2-inspired Edge Detection**: For improved visual quality

## üß© How It Works

The player uses the following shader-based pipeline to enhance video:

1. **Edge Detection**: Identifies edges in the video frame
2. **Upscaling**: Uses FSR EASU (Edge-Adaptive Spatial Upsampling) to intelligently upscale content
3. **Sharpening**: Applies dynamic sharpening with configurable intensity
4. **Color Processing**: Maintains proper color space transformations

Controls allow you to toggle the enhancement effects to compare the original and enhanced video quality in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can adjust several parameters in the `shader.js` file:

```javascript
// Parameter tuning
#define SHARPENING 2.0    // Sharpening intensity (0.0 to 2.0 recommended)
#define CONTRAST 2.0      // High contrast adaptation range
#define EDGE_THRESHOLD 0.15 // Threshold for edge detection
#define EDGE_WEIGHT 1.2   // Weight applied to detected edges
```
